        The Benefits of a Well-Designed page
    </h2>

        You can layer on more 
        complexity, but you don’t want to start with
         a cluttered mess and have to selectively prune it.
          Always begin with the basics. When you begin planning out your homepage design, 
           make sure every element satisfies at least one of the following four goals.<br>When you can answer those questions, 
           you’ll have the information
           you need for better homepage design. 
           In web design, homepage elements have very specific purposes.<br>

           You can add complexity to a simple homepage design, but you don’t want to start with 
           a cluttered mess and have to selectively prune it.
            Always begin with the basics.

What do you need on your homepage? What will your audience expect? And which elements take priority?
<br> <br>
<b>Helping your target audience get to know your business</b>
<br><br>
Many of your website visitors will find your homepage first. With that in mind, you need to make a
 solid first impression.
<br>
<br>Your homepage should provide a sense of your company’s values, unique selling proposition (USP)
 and purpose. You’re more likely to lure in potential customers if you can effectively communicate this information.

    I love the Slack homepage design because of its unique illustrations. You can’t go wrong with custom graphics. I also like the tagline — “Where Work Happens” — because it’s creative. <br> 
    <br>
    but it also encapsulates the tool’s purpose.

Slack makes it clear what visitors should do. They can sign in or create an account. Here, we have more navigation options than Dropbox provides, but each contributes to helping visitors find what they want.

I’m going with another example of custom graphics. Green Mountain Energy leaves no doubt about the company’s purpose. It wants to provide clean energy at an affordable price. There are two equal CTAs — one for residential customers and one for business owners — that use contrasting colors to draw the eye.

    I like dropbox design because of its unique illustrations. You can’t go wrong with custom graphics. I also like the tagline — “Where Work Happens” — because it’s creative. <br> 
    <br>
    I’ve called out Dropbox before as an excellent example of good marketing all around. The company’s homepage is no different. You have a slightly askew hero image that draws the eye and two CTAs — one of which uses a dark background to draw more attention since it’s for the paid version of the tool.
